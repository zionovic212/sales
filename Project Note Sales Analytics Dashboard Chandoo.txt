Business Problem
- Chocolate Sales Analytics
- Sales, Boxes, Costs & Profits
- Performance of Sales-persons & Product performance
- Low box shipment(details later)
- MoM & YoY changes to key metrics


Step 1: Data Model - Star Schema
Data is stored in 5 tables
- Table Shipments is the fact table
- 4 dimension table: Sales Person, Product, Geography, Calendar
Every shipment of the chocolate is done by sales person, on a specific product, and the shipment is sent to a specific geography, on a specific date.


Step 2: Calculations needed for analysis
- Total sales
     Total Sales = SUM(shipments[sales])

- Total boxes
    Total Boxes = SUM(shipments[boxes])

- Total shipments
    Total Shipments = COUNTROWS(shipments)

- Total cost (i.e. total cost per shipment)
    Total Cost = SUMX(shipments, shipments[Boxes] * RELATED(products[Cost per box]))

- Total profit   
    Total Profit = [Total Sales] - [Total Cost]


- Profit %
    Profit % = DIVIDE(Total Profit, Total Cost)   ----[Chandoo made a mistake in his calculation, he used total profit/ total sales]

- LBS(Low box shipment) count.. How many shipment have less than 50 boxes of chocolate.
    LBS Count = CALCULATE([Total Shipments], shipments[Boxes]<50)

- LBS %
    LBS % = DIVIDE([LBS count], [Total shipments])
    
- MoM changes (This means the changes from one month to another. i.e. percentage change from Jan to Feb, Feb to March, etc. )
  - Create a new column in the calendar table for the calculations.
  - To calculate MoM changes in total sales. We need to create a another measure(in DAX) that will calculate 'total sales' previous month
    This measure will now be used to calculate the % difference between the months (MoM Sales Changes %).

  Total Sales (prev month) = CALCULATE([Total Sales], PREVIOUSMONTH('calender'[Date]))
  PREVIOUSMONTH is a built-in function.

  MoM Sales Changes % =
	Var this_month = [Total Sales]
	Var prev_month = [Total sales (prev)]
  return
	DIVIDE(this_month - prev_month, pre_month)

- YoY changes

It is normal to keep calculations and measures inside one of the tables in the data model. However, when you want include many
calculations inside your project, it is cleaner/clearer to just create a separate "measure" table.

**If you are using a calendar table in your project, ALWAYS mark it has date table.
- It will tell Power BI that this is our date table and should be used for all time intelligence calculations.

DATE/CALENDER
**When dealing with date related calculation, visuals or analysis.
Firstly, note that it is better to have a calendar table.
In the calendar table, make sure you have 'Start of the month' column. This is useful in cases where you want to calculate date trend in month
and you want it follow chronological order(Jan, Feb, March).
If you don't have start of the month and you use 'month' or 'name of month' you will have an Ascending or descending order arrangement based
on the measure, which is not helpful.

Step 3: Create dashboard
- First, edit the canvas and customise the width and length. Using 1080(H) * 1920(W)
- Create all the cards, using new card
- Add 'reference labels', this is something new. Never used it before.(Something like comparison at a glance)

- When I added the reference label(MoM sales change %) to the Total Sales card. Nothing came out and it makes no sense. This is a problem that needed to be solved.
- To solve the above problem, I need to create a new measure called 'Latest Date', this will capture the last date in the 'Start of Month' column.
    Latest Date = LASTDATE('calendar'[start of Month])

- Then we added another measure called 'Total Sales Latest Month'
    Total Sales Latest Month = 
	Var ld = [Latest Date]
     Return
	CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'calendar'[Start of Month] = ld)

- Then we add another measure called 'Latest MoM Sales Change %'
    Latest MoM Sales Change % =
	var ld = [Latest Date]
	var this_month_sales = [Total Sales Latest Month]
	var prev_month_sales = CALCULATE([Total Sales], 'calendar'[Start of Month]= EDATE(ld,-1))

    Return
	DIVIDE(this_month_sales - prev_month_sales, prev_month_sales)

- Save and Publish the project

---Low Shipment Analysis Chart---
- First, I create a NEW GROUP inside the shipment table. What does new group mean?
New Group is a BIN size in histogram. It is used when the range of the data to be inserted in the Y or X axis is too long.
The group is created from the Box column.
- Create a histogram(stacked column chart) and toggle-on the zoom slider.
